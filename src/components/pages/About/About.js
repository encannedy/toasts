            <p>Hello! My name is Erica Cannedy. Iâ€™m an aspiring Full Stack Developer seeking a new challenging
            career. Prior to embarking on a Full Stack Developer career my experience was built around client wellness and safety as a mental health practitioner.  As a practitioner I am client and solution focused which is the same perspective I bring to working on full stab web design.  I am a hard working individual who is eager to continue developing my skills and advance my knowledge.  </p>
            <p>I've worked on various solo project as well as various group projects which is where my strength lies.  I work well with others and feel a collaborative approach is the best working style for me. </p>
